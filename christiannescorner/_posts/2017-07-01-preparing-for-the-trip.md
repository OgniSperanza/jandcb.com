# Preparing for the Trip
#### (or lack thereof)

Procrastination  is best avoided, or so I here. I, for one, happen to enjoy the exhilarting thrill of waiting until the last moment and managing to get the last bag packed with only a second on the clock.

# Departure
First things first, we need to Van, which means I'll be standing in line at the Budget rental at 8am, hair disheveled, hoping for no upsets.
