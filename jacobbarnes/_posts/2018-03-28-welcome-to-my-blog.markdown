## What are you doing with your life? 

No, this isn't a self referencing question in which I'm going to wax about my goals and goings-on. I'm asking you, reader, what the fuck are you doing? Surely your time is better allocated elsewhere. But here you are. Thanks... I guess.

## So what's this blog even about?

A bunch of meaningless shit I decided to make publically available in an effort to consume the guillable masses' time and energy without creating societal value. More specifically, my rantings on politics and philosophy, various stories and writing projects, etc. 

## What are you doing with your life? 

Ok, this time it is self referencing, but I'm not just going to give you the answer, you indolent fucks; read my blog. 

## Why bother?

Reader, you probably shouldn't. But hell, who knows, maybe one day I'll gain some sort of celebrity and maybe you're the type of person who posts, "FIRST," as a reply, or perhaps, you're the "I did X before it was cool," type. I mean, I would claim it's because of the high quality content and the desire to facilitate meaningful dialogues, but I've already revealed my sisnter plan to drain society of valuable resources.
